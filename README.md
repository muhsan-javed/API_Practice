# API-Practice
In Android, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that developers use to build applications that interact with the Android operating system. The Android API provides developers with access to various components of the system, including the camera, sensors, network connectivity, and user interface elements. By using the Android API, developers can create applications that take advantage of the full range of capabilities offered by Android devices. Additionally, the Android API provides a way for developers to interact with other applications and services on the device, allowing them to create more complex and integrated applications.
